JavaScript Object
	Js Object is a kind of datatype whre the values are stored as key value pair. object's values are mutuable so that we can change or create new key value
"e.g: Object["key"]=new value or changing value".This will create or change the values. for deleting using delete keyword we can delete the certain key value pair.
The value of the Object can be any datatype. In ES6 using spread operator we can change or modify the object.

Object example:
	var assignment={
	"title":"First_assignment",
	"status":"completed"
}
